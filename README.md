All code used in paper "Bit-wise Mixture Differential Cryptanalysis and Its Application to SIMON" and the contents of the attachment

## SIMON
The SIMON folder contains the code for the automated search of SIMON's Mixture Differential Distinguisher for 5 versions.
By adjusting the function's parameter 1 and parameter 2 it is possible to find mixed-difference discriminative paths with probability less than or equal to parameter 2 for different numbers of rounds
